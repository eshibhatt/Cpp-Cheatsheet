# Cpp-Cheatsheet
 Suggested flow of acquiring any programming language (in my opinion):

1. Basics I/O
2. Operators
3. Type-Casting
4. Pointers
5. Flow of Control
6. Switch Cases
7. Iterative Statements
8. Jump Statements 
9. Scopes
10. Recursion
11. Functions
12. Objects & Classes
13. Arrays


I created these cheatsheets to help my friends who are learning C++.

I have used C++ as my secondary coding language for over 2 years now, so here's my documented code on it, to help you learn.

Note:
1. This is a cheatsheet, therefore it is targeted at people with prior programming experience, and help them get through the basic syntax of C++ in the shortest time possible. However, I have taken my time to document it right, to make it more beginner friendly. Though it should not be your primary source, it can surely help you get a headstart.

2. I have intentionally left the DSA part, as c++ is huge as it is & including DSA here will only confuse you.
