/* Notes-
1. Only addition and subtraction operations are allowed; the others arenâ€™t allowed on pointers.
2.when adding one to a pointer, the pointer is made to point to the following element of the same type,
and, therefore, the size in bytes of the type it points to is added to the pointer.

Dangling Pointers:A dangling pointer is a pointer pointing to a memory location that has been freed (or deleted).
